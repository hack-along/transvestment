# For Future Product

When a home is owner-occupied, rent no longer flows.  
  
And at the scale of home economics,  
tools and plants and animals can be owned  
to automatically own those Future Productions  
\*without purchase\*, and so profit no longer flows.

Hmm, but what about all that work?

If we can trade work _**early**_ in time \[maybe by signing work contracts\],  
we can solve the [double-coincidence of wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants) without passing tokens  
for any predictable good or service.

This approach does not banish usury by decree,  
it enables usufruct through promises and property  
held by those who want those results at true cost.

# For Future Product

When owner is occupier,  
rent no longer flows.  
  
At the scale of home economics,  
tools and plants and animals are owned  
to automatically own those Future Productions  
\*without purchase\*, and so profit no longer flows.

Hmm, but what about all that work?

For predictable goods and services,  
we can 'bind' work _**early**_ in time  
by signing legally-binding work contracts.

This solves the [double-coincidence of wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants),  
but only for the things that we know we want.

We all need essential goods and services  
to wash, eat, sleep and dress.  
  
We can easily supply ourselves with all that we need  
in groups of groups, and groups of groups of groups,  
using large-scale ecosystem restoration techniques  
to build permacultured cities owned and operated  
by those citizen-owners through a set of opt-in,  
semi-continuous parallel crowdfunding campaigns.  
  
Want the pothole fixed?  
Commit your skills into the system \[not necessarily fixing potholes\], and if there is a value-match between you and a person that can fix potholes, then you can pay-with-future-work to vote for it to happen.

# For Future Product

When owner is occupier,  
rent no longer flows.  
  
At the scale of home economics,  
tools and plants and animals are already owned  
to automatically own those Future Productions  
\*without purchase\*, and so profit no longer flows.

Hmm, but what about all that work?

For predictable goods and services,  
we can 'bind' work _**early**_ in time  
by signing legally-binding work contracts.

This solves the [double-coincidence of wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants),  
but only for the things that we know we want.

We all need essential goods and services  
to wash, eat, sleep and dress.  
  
We can easily supply ourselves with all that we need  
in groups of groups, and groups of groups of groups,  
using large-scale ecosystem restoration techniques  
to build permacultured cities owned and operated  
by those citizen-owners through a set of opt-in,  
semi-continuous parallel crowdfunding campaigns.  
  
Want the pothole fixed?  
Commit your skills into the system \[not necessarily fixing potholes\], and if there is a value-match between you and a person that can fix potholes, then you can pay-with-future-work to vote for it to happen.  
  
**Open Source Production in the material world through the For Product model.**

**== Plan**  
Find land for sale that can be used to build a permacultured private city.  
Verify the essential goods and services we could produce at that location.

**== Fund**  
Issue Product Tickets representing those future goods and services.  
Auction Product Tickets to secure the land and tools without debt.

**== Work**  
Issue Source Titles representing small amounts of land ownership.  
Issue Work Agreements representing commitments to achieve that production.  
Auction Source Titles to secure Work Agreement signatures.

**== Own**  
If both auctions succeed, buy land and tools and announce first day of work.  
Vest Source Titles to workers as the first round-of-production is completed.  
Workers own the Source Titles used to fulfill Product Tickets they bought.

**== User Interface**  
"'`Buy Product Ticket`'" \[This is like rewards-based crowdfunding.\]  
Pay with future work or money to receive a time-delayed good or service.  
Workers implicitly trade with other workers in this way. \(work-for-work\)

"'`Bid-to-sign Work Agreement`'" \[Pay with future work.\]  
Test to qualify or use the apprenticeship program. \(work-to-learn\)  
Receive a Basic Outcome of essential goods and services. \(sign-to-use\)  
Gain Source Titles as Work Agreements are completed. \(work-to-own\)  
Source Title owners receive future products without purchase. \(own-to-use\)

"'`Define New Product Ticket`'" \[Create a crowdfun \(sic\) campaign.\]  
List work and sources required to begin production.  
List projected delivery schedules and production constraints.  
List pollution and any unavoidable externalities.  
Change \(your version of\) a proposal to vote on implementation details.

"'`Issue Source Titles`'" \[Land acquisition and allocation.\]  
Show map of land for sale, with default being nearest that user.  
Zoom in to see water rights and zoning restrictions.  
Show Product Ticket proposals and funding status.  
Change \(your version of\) a map to vote on the layout.

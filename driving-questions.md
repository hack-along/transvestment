## Can we create a viable legal contract/framework which could guarantee its subscribers a free access to what they need \(+ a basic income for what the network canâ€™t give\) in exchange for their committed work on the commons?



## What kind of use agreements do we need for value generated/borrowed within the commons \(if any\) ?
